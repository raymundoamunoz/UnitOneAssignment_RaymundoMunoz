Square - Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Square Inc. was founded by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey in 2009. Dorsey and McKelvey got together when McKelvey missed an art sale because he was not able to accept credit cards, leading the two to start a method to help facilitate business transactions. In 2009, they received $10M in funding from 20 investors. Now in 2021, square has funded over $600M after more than 10 years. 



## Business Activities:

Square was founded for small businesses to be able to receive payments easier through their technology.  Square has over 20 million customers and growing. Aside from providing their customers with POS solutions, they also provide the public with banking solutions as well as brokerage solution to buy stocks and bitcoin. Some of the tools they use to develop include MySQL, Amazon EC2, as well as programming languages like Java, Ruby, Swift, and Go. They also use PySurvival as a data analysis tool to predict credit risks and when a customer will stop using their services.


## Landscape:

Square is in the Payment and billing domain, among others like personal banking. Some of the major innovations in this domain in the last few years have been nfc payments, electronic receipts, and electronic payments. Other competitors in this space include clover and PayPal.


## Results

In one of their blogs, Square reports that there has been an increase in cashless purchases since 2020 using their products. The team at square uses data analysis to measure customer loyalty and customer acquisition. Compared to competitors like PayPal and Clover, Square has 7% of the market share. 



## Recommendations

Square has a lot of potential to keep growing. Their ability to provide POS solutions, as well as personal banking solution opens the world for them to grow. Now with their ability to send cryptocurrency from one account to another, I would recommend them to expand app support to other countries, facilitating sending bitcoin to other countries. Adding blockchain technology to these solutions would be ideal to continue growth.
